      <p>
        This project is to help start a new project using Angular + Material +
        Zurb Foundation XY Grid. It can be used to quickly scaffold an Angular
        application following best practices and a consistent style sytem.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is easily customizable for your needs. You can start using it right
        away, however you might want to change the color palette, fonts,
        breakpoints, spacing values, etc. This is fully customizable under the
        settings file.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can even change the name of the project (which is used on some of
        the CSS Classes). So, instead of using the class eva-btn &#123;&#125;,
        you can change it for whatever prefix you like.
      </p>
      <p>
        It consists in the following, and more. For further documentation on
        each section and examples please clone the repo.

      <h3>Why Foundation instead of Bootstrap?</h3>
      <p>
        For this project I'm not importing everything in Foundation. Actually
        the only thing that is being import is the XY Grid. This way you can
        change everything in the UI very easily at your own liking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both Bootstrap and Foundation have support for responsive grids and
        flexible breakpoints. However, Foundation has support for responsive
        gutters, which are so easy to setup that seem like magic.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it comes to cleanliness Foundation may have a better grid system
        because Foundation has no containers and relies heavily on rows is a
        plus, as you end up with a cleaner DOM.

          EVA provides three different mixins with responsive media queries:

          <ul>
            <li>resolutions-above($resolution)</li>
            <li>resolutions-below($resolution)</li>
            <li>resolutions-between($min, $max)</li>
          </ul>

          Use these mixins under any SCSS rule and use your own rules.

          Eva overrides the default Angular Material Snackbar component styles
          for a better "alert" notification looking component. The usage is the
          same as the material component, but you have 3 classes out of the box
          for different alerts.
